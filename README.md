# inspect-jwt-cli (In progress)

## Description

A human friendly JWT inspector for your terminal.

## Background

Why are we constantly using https://jwt.io/ when actually we can craft faster and better user experience.
It's time to stop sharing data with 3rd party and take the controle back of our JWT. ðŸ”¥

## Installation

```sh
curl https://simple-jwt.atalent-labs./install.sh | bash
```


## Usage

#### Copy your JWT, we take care of the rest

Actually most of the time when we want to inspect a JWT the first step is to copy it into the clipboard.
So... Let's get a good use of that clipboard!

Only run:

```
jwt
```

Then from there you will receice the following response:

```

  "token_id": "b9a5fb2b-370d-4492-aab7-bf5ade322bb6",
  "type": "Bearer",
