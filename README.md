# hwt-cli (In progress)


## Description

An opinionated human friendly JWT inspector for your terminal.

## Background

Why are we constantly using https://jwt.io/, but actually I don't know about you but personally I just new a few information.
But we get overwhelmed by this poor user experience. Adding to this the data privacy...
I decided that it was time to stop sharing data with 3rd party and take the controle back of my JWT. ðŸ”¥

## Installation

```sh
curl https://simple-jwt.atalent-labs./install.sh | bash
```

## Usage

#### Copy your JWT, we take care of the rest

Actually most of the time when we want to inspect a JWT the first step is to copy it into the clipboard.
So... Let's get a good use of that clipboard!

Only run:

```
hwt
```

Then from there you will receice the following response:

### `--claim` to filter

If you need to isolate a specific claim you can use the option `--claim`

```
jwt --table
```

```
